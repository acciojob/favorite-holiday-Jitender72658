	<h1> Switzerland </h1> 
	<br>
	<p>
		The amazing mountains, heaps of lakes and beautiful villages make for the most beautiful scenery in Switzerland. These landscapes are considered to be what makes Switzerland the perfect destination for vacationing and exploring new cultures.

The high-peak Alps and mountains make up to 62% of the country’s territory. Even though Switzerland is relatively small geographically, one can feel practically overwhelmed when it comes to choosing where to go first. If you are particularly interested in winter activities, Switzerland has a lot to offer.

Each city in Switzerland has its own individuality, with different landscapes and their unique city life. Cities like Zurich, Bern, Geneva, and Basel among others, offer a different perspective of Switzerland and its diverse culture. On the other hand, if you want to experience the ultimate tourist attractions a guide on the ultimate must-visit places in Switzerland is your best friend.
